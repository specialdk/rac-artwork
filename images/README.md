# Images Directory

This directory is for storing images locally (optional).

## Recommended Approach: Cloud Storage

For this project, we recommend **NOT** storing images in this directory, but instead using cloud image hosting. Here's why:

### Benefits of Cloud Storage:
- ✅ Faster loading times (CDN)
- ✅ No repository bloat
- ✅ Easy to update images
- ✅ Better for Git (smaller repo size)
- ✅ Works perfectly with Google Sheets

### Recommended Image Hosting:

**Option 1: Google Drive** (Easiest)
1. Upload image to Google Drive
2. Right-click → Share → "Anyone with link can view"
3. Get shareable link
4. Use link in Google Sheets

**Option 2: Cloudinary** (Best for Production)
- Free tier: 25GB storage, 25GB bandwidth/month
- Automatic optimization
- Image transformations
- CDN delivery
- Sign up: https://cloudinary.com

**Option 3: Imgur** (Quick & Easy)
- Free image hosting
- No account needed
- Direct image URLs
- Upload: https://imgur.com/upload

## If You Want to Store Images Locally

If you prefer to store images in this directory:

### Directory Structure:
```
images/
├── artworks/
│   ├── artwork-1.jpg
│   ├── artwork-2.jpg
│   └── artwork-3.jpg
├── artists/
│   └── wanyubi-marika.jpg
└── site/
    ├── logo.png
    └── hero-bg.jpg
```

### Usage in Google Sheets:
After deploying to Netlify, your URLs would be:
```
https://your-site.netlify.app/images/artworks/artwork-1.jpg
```

### Image Requirements:
- **Format:** JPG or PNG
- **Size:** Maximum 2MB per image (optimize first!)
- **Dimensions:** 
  - Artworks: 1200px wide minimum
  - Artist photos: 600px wide minimum
  - Thumbnails: Auto-generated by CSS

### Image Optimization Tools:
- **TinyPNG:** https://tinypng.com (compress without quality loss)
- **Squoosh:** https://squoosh.app (Google's image optimizer)
- **ImageOptim:** https://imageoptim.com (Mac app)

## Placeholder Images

While developing or testing, use placeholder images:

### Service: placeholder.com
```
https://via.placeholder.com/600x800?text=Artwork+Title
https://via.placeholder.com/400x400?text=Artist+Photo
```

### Usage Examples:
```
Artwork: https://via.placeholder.com/1200x900?text=Artwork+1
Artist: https://via.placeholder.com/600x600?text=Artist+Name
```

## Image Best Practices

### Quality Guidelines:
- **Artwork photos:**
  - High resolution (at least 1200px wide)
  - Well-lit, neutral background
  - Show full artwork
  - Accurate colors
  - Consider professional photography

- **Artist photos:**
  - Professional but authentic
  - Good lighting
  - Appropriate for cultural context
  - Obtain permission

### Technical Requirements:
- Use JPG for photos (smaller file size)
- Use PNG for graphics/logos (better quality)
- Compress all images before uploading
- Target file size: Under 500KB per image

### Naming Convention:
```
Bad:  IMG_1234.jpg, photo.jpg, image.png
Good: wanyubi-marika-artwork-1.jpg
      artist-wanyubi-marika.jpg
      artwork-gapu-water-ceremony.jpg
```

### SEO Tips:
- Use descriptive filenames
- Add alt text in HTML
- Compress for faster loading
- Use lazy loading for large galleries

---

## Copyright & Permissions

### Important Reminders:
- ✅ Get artist permission for all photos
- ✅ Verify you have rights to use images
- ✅ Document image sources
- ✅ Respect cultural protocols
- ✅ Some artwork may have restrictions

### Cultural Sensitivity:
- Some artworks may have cultural restrictions
- Obtain proper permissions
- Respect artist's wishes
- Consider cultural protocols around imagery

## Current Setup

This project is configured to use **external image URLs** in Google Sheets.

### To Use:
1. Upload images to cloud storage (Google Drive, Cloudinary, etc.)
2. Get direct image URL
3. Add URL to Google Sheets
4. Images load automatically on site

### No Local Images Needed! ✨

---

## Troubleshooting

### Images Not Loading:
- ✅ Check URL is direct link (ends in .jpg, .png)
- ✅ Test URL in new browser tab
- ✅ Verify image is public/accessible
- ✅ Check for HTTPS (secure) URLs
- ✅ Look for CORS issues in browser console

### Google Drive Issues:
- Make sure file is public
- Use "Share link" not "Embed link"
- Some Google Drive URLs may not work as direct images
- Consider Cloudinary for better reliability

### Image Quality Issues:
- Don't over-compress (balance size vs quality)
- Use appropriate dimensions for use case
- Consider using image CDN for automatic optimization

## Migration Plan

If you start local and want to move to cloud later:

1. Upload all images to Cloudinary/Drive
2. Update URLs in Google Sheets
3. Test that all images load
4. Can keep local images as backup
5. Eventually remove from repository

---

## Summary

**Recommended:** Use cloud image hosting with URLs in Google Sheets  
**Alternative:** Store images in this directory and reference by path  
**Development:** Use placeholder images until you have real content
